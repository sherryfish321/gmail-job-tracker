## Architecture

```
Gmail API  -->  FastAPI Backend  -->  Ollama (dual model)  -->  SQLite
                     |
               React Dashboard
```

- **Backend:** FastAPI + SQLite + Ollama
- **Frontend:** React (Vite) with warm-orange glass UI theme
- **LLM:** Local Ollama with dual-model setup -- qwen2.5-coder:7b for email classification, qwen3:8b for AI chat
- **Database:** SQLite with 4 tables (emails, analyses, applications, application_emails) and 2 views

---

## Features

- **Automated Email Fetching** -- Gmail API with configurable search queries, ATS sender matching (Greenhouse, Lever, Workday, etc.), and noise filtering
- **LLM-Powered Classification** -- 13 email types (application confirm, rejection, interview invite, offer, action needed, recruiter outreach, etc.) with role normalization that standardizes job titles and levels across emails
- **Interactive Dashboard** -- Stats cards, Sankey funnel, trend chart (day/3-day/week/month granularity), role breakdown, and expandable application table
- **AI Chat Assistant** -- Chat with Ollama using your application data as context for personalized job search advice
- **Sync with Date Filters** -- Sync panel in the UI to specify date range and max emails before fetching
- **Action Items** -- Toggleable checklist with pending/completed sections, shows all applications with actions regardless of status (interview, action needed, etc.), checkable from both the Action Items card and the application table
- **Application Detail** -- Expandable rows showing original email subjects linked to each application
- **Manual Status Override** -- Click any status badge in the application table to change it via dropdown (applied, interview, offer, action needed, rejected)
- **Sortable Columns and Search** -- Sort by date, company, role, or status (ascending/descending), search by company or role, filter by action item presence
- **Smart Role Handling** -- LLM prompt normalizes job titles (e.g. "SWE" to "Software Engineer") and levels (e.g. "New Grad" to "Entry Level"). When no role is detected, the system uses "{Company} General" as a fallback to keep same-company emails grouped

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Node.js 18+
- Ollama installed with two models: qwen2.5-coder:7b (classification) and qwen3:8b (chat)
- Google Cloud project with Gmail API enabled and OAuth credentials

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/gmail-jobtracker.git
cd gmail-jobtracker

# Place your Google OAuth credentials file in the project root
cp /path/to/credentials.json .

# Pull the Ollama models
ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:7b
ollama pull qwen3:8b

# Run setup (creates venv, installs Python + Node dependencies, runs checks)
chmod +x setup.sh start.sh
./setup.sh
```

---

## Usage

### Start Everything

```bash
# Start backend + frontend
./start.sh

# Start with sync first (fetch + analyze, then start)
./start.sh --sync

# Sync a specific date range, then start
./start.sh --sync --after 2026/02/01 --before 2026/02/28 --max 200
```

Open http://localhost:5173 to view the dashboard.

### CLI

```bash
# Full pipeline: fetch -> analyze -> start server
python main.py

# API server only (no fetch/analyze)
python main.py --serve

# Fetch + analyze only (no server)
python main.py --sync

# With date filters
python main.py --sync --after 2026/02/01 --before 2026/02/15 --max 50
```

### Sync from the UI

Click the **Sync Now** button in the dashboard header to open the sync panel. You can specify a date range (After / Before) and max number of emails before starting. Progress is logged in the terminal, and a result banner appears in the UI when complete.

## Customization Guide

This project is designed so you can tune its behavior without touching application logic. There are three levels of customization, each with a dedicated config file.

### Configuration

General settings live in `config.py` with environment variable overrides for deployment flexibility:

| Variable | Env Override | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| DB_PATH | JT_DB_PATH | tracker.db |
| OLLAMA_BASE_URL | JT_OLLAMA_URL | http://localhost:11434 |
| OLLAMA_MODEL_ANALYZE | JT_OLLAMA_MODEL_ANALYZE | qwen2.5-coder:7b |
| OLLAMA_MODEL_CHAT | JT_OLLAMA_MODEL_CHAT | qwen3:8b |
| API_HOST | JT_API_HOST | 0.0.0.0 |
| API_PORT | JT_API_PORT | 8000 |

---

### Gmail Search Query

If you're missing job-related emails, the search query is the first place to look. It lives in `config.py` under `GMAIL_SEARCH_KEYWORDS`.

**How it works:**

The query uses Gmail search syntax and combines three strategies:

1. **Keyword matching (full-body search)** -- catches emails mentioning application, interview, offer, etc.
2. **ATS sender matching** -- catches emails from common applicant tracking systems (Greenhouse, Lever, Workday, etc.) regardless of content
3. **Noise exclusion** -- filters out security codes, password resets, newsletters

**Common adjustments:**

| Scenario | What to change |
|----------|---------------|
| Missing emails from a specific ATS | Add the sender domain to the `from:(...)` block |
| Missing emails with unusual subjects | Add keywords to the main keyword block |
| Too many false positives | Add terms to the exclusion block `-{subject:(...)}` |
| Want to search a different date range | Change `GMAIL_DEFAULT_AFTER` in config.py, or use `--after` flag |

**Example -- adding a new ATS provider:**

```python
# In config.py, find GMAIL_SEARCH_KEYWORDS and add to the from:() block:
"OR from:(greenhouse OR lever OR workday OR ashby OR smartrecruiters "
"OR hackerrank OR indeed OR breezy OR icims OR taleo)"
#                                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ added
```

**Tip:** If you're unsure what to add, ask Gemini (which has Gmail integration) to analyze your inbox and suggest patterns.

### LLM Prompts

All LLM behavior is controlled through a single file: `llm/prompts.py`. This is the only file you need to edit when tuning classification accuracy or chat quality.

| Prompt | What it controls | When to change |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| `SYSTEM_PROMPT` | Email classification -- what types to detect, JSON output schema, classification rules, role normalization mappings | LLM misclassifies emails, role names are inconsistent, or extraction quality is poor |
| `build_user_prompt()` | How email content is formatted before sending to LLM | You want to include more/fewer email fields, or change truncation length |
| `CHAT_SYSTEM_PROMPT` | AI Chat persona -- tone, response length, behavior rules | You want the chat assistant to respond differently |
| `build_chat_context()` | What application data is injected into chat context | You want the assistant to know about different metrics |

**Role normalization** is handled in `SYSTEM_PROMPT` with two layers of mapping:

- **Title mapping** -- abbreviations to full names (e.g. "SDE" to "Software Engineer", "ML Engineer" to "Machine Learning Engineer")
- **Level mapping** -- various seniority terms to standardized levels (e.g. "New Grad", "Early Career", "Junior" all map to "Entry Level"; "Internship", "Co-op" map to "Intern")

To add custom mappings, edit the role normalization rules in the `SYSTEM_PROMPT` section of `llm/prompts.py`.

**Example -- improving role extraction:**

If the LLM frequently returns `role: null` for application confirmation emails, add a hint to `SYSTEM_PROMPT`:

```python
# In llm/prompts.py, add to the Rules section:
"""
Rules:
- ...existing rules...
- For application_confirm emails, look for the role in the subject line,
  email body, and any "position" or "role" mentions. If the role is not
  explicitly stated, infer it from context (e.g. "Thank you for applying
  to our Engineering team" -> role could be "Software Engineer").
"""
```

**Example -- changing chat behavior:**

To make the AI assistant more detailed or change its focus:

```python
# In llm/prompts.py, edit CHAT_SYSTEM_PROMPT:
CHAT_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a helpful job search assistant for a graduate student.
Focus on actionable next steps and prioritization.
When analyzing the application data, highlight patterns such as:
- Which companies are most responsive
- What roles have the highest interview rate
- Time-sensitive deadlines or follow-ups
Keep responses under 200 words."""
```

**Testing prompt changes:**

After editing prompts, you don't need to re-fetch emails. Just re-analyze:

```bash
# Delete existing analyses and applications to re-run with new prompts
python -c "
from db.database import get_conn
conn = get_conn()
conn.execute('DELETE FROM application_emails')
conn.execute('DELETE FROM applications')
conn.execute('DELETE FROM analyses')
conn.commit()
conn.close()
print('Cleared. Run sync to re-analyze.')
"

# Re-analyze all emails with updated prompts
python main.py --sync
```

## Known Issues and Roadmap

### Known Issues

- start.sh requires pressing Ctrl+C twice to fully stop
- Python 3.9 shows FutureWarning from google-auth and urllib3 NotOpenSSLWarning (functional, upgrade Python to fix)
- If manual sync and auto-sync run simultaneously, duplicate processing may occur (unlikely in practice)

### Roadmap

- Application delete -- remove misclassified or unwanted application records from the dashboard

---

## Tech Stack
