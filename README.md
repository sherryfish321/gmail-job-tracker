## Architecture

```
Gmail API  -->  FastAPI Backend  -->  Ollama (qwen3:8b)  -->  SQLite
                     |
               React Dashboard

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Node.js 18+
- Ollama installed with qwen3:8b model
- Google Cloud project with Gmail API enabled and OAuth credentials

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/gmail-jobtracker.git
cd gmail-jobtracker

# Place your Google OAuth credentials file in the project root
cp /path/to/credentials.json .

# Pull the Ollama model
ollama pull qwen3:8b

# Run setup (creates venv, installs Python + Node dependencies, runs checks)
chmod +x setup.sh start.sh
./setup.sh
```

---

## Usage

### Start Everything

```bash
# Start backend + frontend
./start.sh

# Start with sync first (fetch + analyze, then start)
./start.sh --sync

# Sync a specific date range, then start
./start.sh --sync --after 2026/02/01 --before 2026/02/28 --max 200
```

Open http://localhost:5173 to view the dashboard.

### CLI

```bash
# Full pipeline: fetch -> analyze -> start server
python main.py

# API server only (no fetch/analyze)
python main.py --serve

# Fetch + analyze only (no server)
python main.py --sync

# With date filters
python main.py --sync --after 2026/02/01 --before 2026/02/15 --max 50
```

### Sync from the UI

Click the **Sync Now** button in the dashboard header to open the sync panel. You can specify a date range (After / Before) and max number of emails before starting. Progress is logged in the terminal, and a result banner appears in the UI when complete.

## Customization Guide

This project is designed so you can tune its behavior without touching application logic. There are three levels of customization, each with a dedicated config file.

### Configuration

General settings live in `config.py` with environment variable overrides for deployment flexibility:

| Variable | Env Override | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| DB_PATH | JT_DB_PATH | tracker.db |
| OLLAMA_BASE_URL | JT_OLLAMA_URL | http://localhost:11434 |
| OLLAMA_MODEL | JT_OLLAMA_MODEL | qwen3:8b |
| API_HOST | JT_API_HOST | 0.0.0.0 |
| API_PORT | JT_API_PORT | 8000 |

### Gmail Search Query

If you're missing job-related emails, the search query is the first place to look. It lives in `config.py` under `GMAIL_SEARCH_KEYWORDS`.

**How it works:**

The query uses Gmail search syntax and combines three strategies:

1. **Keyword matching (full-body search)** -- catches emails mentioning application, interview, offer, etc.
2. **ATS sender matching** -- catches emails from common applicant tracking systems (Greenhouse, Lever, Workday, etc.) regardless of content
3. **Noise exclusion** -- filters out security codes, password resets, newsletters

**Common adjustments:**

| Scenario | What to change |
|----------|---------------|
| Missing emails from a specific ATS | Add the sender domain to the `from:(...)` block |
| Missing emails with unusual subjects | Add keywords to the main keyword block |
| Too many false positives | Add terms to the exclusion block `-{subject:(...)}` |
| Want to search a different date range | Change `GMAIL_DEFAULT_AFTER` in config.py, or use `--after` flag |

**Example -- adding a new ATS provider:**

```python
# In config.py, find GMAIL_SEARCH_KEYWORDS and add to the from:() block:
"OR from:(greenhouse OR lever OR workday OR ashby OR smartrecruiters "
"OR hackerrank OR indeed OR breezy OR icims OR taleo)"
#                                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ added
```

**Tip:** If you're unsure what to add, ask Gemini (which has Gmail integration) to analyze your inbox and suggest patterns.

### LLM Prompts

All LLM behavior is controlled through a single file: `llm/prompts.py`. This is the only file you need to edit when tuning classification accuracy or chat quality.

| Prompt | What it controls | When to change |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| `SYSTEM_PROMPT` | Email classification -- what types to detect, JSON output schema, classification rules | LLM misclassifies emails or extraction quality is poor |
| `build_user_prompt()` | How email content is formatted before sending to LLM | You want to include more/fewer email fields, or change truncation length |
| `CHAT_SYSTEM_PROMPT` | AI Chat persona -- tone, response length, behavior rules | You want the chat assistant to respond differently |
| `build_chat_context()` | What application data is injected into chat context | You want the assistant to know about different metrics |

**Example -- improving role extraction:**

If the LLM frequently returns `role: null` for application confirmation emails, add a hint to `SYSTEM_PROMPT`:

```python
# In llm/prompts.py, add to the Rules section:
"""
Rules:
- ...existing rules...
- For application_confirm emails, look for the role in the subject line,
  email body, and any "position" or "role" mentions. If the role is not
  explicitly stated, infer it from context (e.g. "Thank you for applying
  to our Engineering team" -> role could be "Software Engineer").
"""
```

**Example -- changing chat behavior:**

To make the AI assistant more detailed or change its focus:

```python
# In llm/prompts.py, edit CHAT_SYSTEM_PROMPT:
CHAT_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a helpful job search assistant for a graduate student.
Focus on actionable next steps and prioritization.
When analyzing the application data, highlight patterns such as:
- Which companies are most responsive
- What roles have the highest interview rate
- Time-sensitive deadlines or follow-ups
Keep responses under 200 words."""
```

**Testing prompt changes:**

After editing prompts, you don't need to re-fetch emails. Just re-analyze:

```bash
# Delete existing analyses to re-run with new prompts
python -c "
from db.database import get_conn
conn = get_conn()
conn.execute('DELETE FROM analyses')
conn.commit()
conn.close()
print('Analyses cleared. Run sync to re-analyze.')
"

# Re-analyze all emails with updated prompts
python main.py --sync
```

## Known Issues and Roadmap

### To Do

- Role normalization -- aggregate similar titles (e.g. "SWE Intern" and "Software Engineering Intern")
- Upsert matching improvement -- emails with role=None not merging correctly when company has multiple roles (revisit after role normalization)

### Not Planned

- Docker Compose
- CSV/PDF export
